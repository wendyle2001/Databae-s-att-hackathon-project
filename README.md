Goal: Make a website with some of the brainstormed features below.

**_Plan_**

- Heat map (Network quality, coverage, speed, latency in area)
- Bar graph (Compare performance between 4g and 5g)
- Pie Chart (Areas served by 5g)
- Interactive Game (Test bandwidth, compare user scores, gather player data)
    - ex) Pong, Reaction Test, Pictionary, Race, Quiz, Cards, Memory


**_Possible Features_**
- Use website as an education hub on Fiber / 5G

- Find cost efficient routes for new fibers cables
- Find best area to expand based on cost, user need, population density, etc
- Identify the type of client that would benefit the most

- Display availability based on user input (address)
